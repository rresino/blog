title: A new blog was born ...

Yes, I created a new blog to put some information about technology and software development.

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate it from markdown pages.

## How to create your blog using Jekyll and Github

1. Fork the repo [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), upper right option.
2. Rename the repo with any name.
3. Update the file `_config.yml`.
4. And enjoy testing it.
